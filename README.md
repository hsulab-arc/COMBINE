# Library 2 Analysis

## Overview

Library 2 consists of bivalent epigenetic editors with unique 20bp barcodes. The analysis workflow involves three main steps:
1. Extracting barcodes from Nanopore sequencing data to establish barcode-to-editor mappings
2. Counting barcodes from NGS data to quantify representation of each construct
3. Matching barcodes between tables to create a comprehensive mapping of barcode counts to effector combinations

This pipeline processes data from screens targeting CD81, calculating enrichment scores to identify effective epigenetic editor combinations.

## Installation and Setup

Before running the analysis pipeline, you'll need to set up your environment with the necessary packages and tools.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the COMBINE repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsulab-arc/COMBINE.git
cd COMBINE
```

### Install Dependencies

The analysis pipeline requires Python 3.9 and several packages. It is recommended to install these in a dedicated conda environment:

```bash
# First create base environment with Python and standard packages
conda create -n combine python=3.9
conda activate combine
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge cutadapt minimap2 fastp seqfu
conda install numpy pandas scipy
```

### Directory Structure

Make sure your directory structure follows this pattern:

```
COMBINE/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bc_extraction.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ count_barcodes.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ match_barcodes.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ effector_details.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fastqs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nanopore/ # For nanopore barcode mapping fastqs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unmerged/ # For raw NGS fastqs
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Barcode Extraction from Nanopore Data

The `bc_extraction.py` script maps Nanopore reads to identify both effector domains (EF1 and EF2) and their associated barcodes.

```bash
python bc_extraction.py
```

#### Process

1. **EF1 Mapping**: 
   - Identifies the EF1 sequence using flanking regions with cutadapt
   - Maps the extracted sequence to reference effectors using minimap2
   - Assigns effector identities to reads based on sequence identity

2. **EF2 Mapping**:
   - Similar process to identify and map EF2 sequences
   - Uses different flanking regions specific to EF2

3. **Barcode Extraction**:
   - Identifies the barcode sequence between EF2 and a downstream constant region
   - Extracts 10-30bp sequences representing the barcodes
   - Associates barcodes with their read IDs

4. **Barcode-to-Effector Mapping**:
   - Joins EF1, EF2, and barcode information using read IDs
   - Creates a comprehensive mapping table (mappedBCs.csv)
   - Removes duplicates to ensure data integrity

This step creates `mappedBCs.csv` containing barcode-to-effector mappings.

### Step 2: Barcode Counting from NGS Data

The `count_barcodes.py` script processes NGS data to quantify the representation of each barcode across different samples.

```bash
python count_barcodes.py
```

#### Process

1. **Read Merging**:
   - Merges paired-end reads using fastp
   - Requires at least 20bp overlap between R1 and R2
   - Uses multithreading for efficient processing

2. **Barcode Extraction**:
   - Trims reads to isolate barcode sequences using cutadapt
   - Extracts sequences between consistent flanking regions
   - Filters for sequences between 10-30bp in length

3. **Barcode Counting**:
   - Dereplicated sequences using seqfu
   - Tabulates unique barcode sequences and their counts
   - Processes each sample independently

4. **Barcode Table Creation**:
   - Combines counts from all samples into a single table
   - Sorts barcodes by total abundance across samples
   - Generates a comprehensive barcode count table (BCTable.csv)

This step produces `BCTable.csv` with barcode counts across samples.

### Step 3: Barcode Matching and Enrichment Calculation

The `match_barcodes.py` script integrates the data from Steps 1 and 2 and calculates enrichment scores for effector combinations.

```bash
python match_barcodes.py --barcode_table BCTable.csv --mapped_bcs mappedBCs.csv --effector_details effector_details.csv --output_dir ./data
```

#### Process

1. **Read and Filter Data**:
   - Combine barcode counts with mapped barcodes from Nanopore data
   - Filter out barcodes with homopolymer repeats (potential sequencing errors)
   - Organize by effector combinations

2. **Create Effector Combination Matrix**:
   - Index by EF1, EF2, and barcode
   - Group by effector combinations to calculate total counts
   - Output comprehensive raw counts table

3. **Calculate Enrichment Scores**:
   - Filter combinations based on minimum read counts
   - Normalize read counts across bins
   - Calculate HIGH/LOW ratio for each replicate
   - Compute geometric mean of replicates

#### Output Files

The script generates multiple output files:
- `raw_counts.csv`: Count of each barcode for each effector combination
- `CD81_Day0_normalized.csv`: Normalized counts and enrichment scores for CD81 at 5 days with doxycycline
- `CD81_Day12_normalized.csv`: Normalized counts and enrichment scores for CD81 at 12 days memory

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels, regex
- External tools:
  - cutadapt
  - minimap2
  - fastp
  - seqfu

## Notes

- The barcode extraction process is optimized for the specific structure of Library 2 constructs
- The pipeline can process large datasets efficiently using parallelization
- Error rate parameters can be adjusted for different levels of sequence stringency
- Homopolymer filtering removes barcodes that may contain sequencing errors
- Effector combinations are sorted by protein length for consistent organization
